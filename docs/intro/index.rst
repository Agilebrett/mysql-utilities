Using the MySQL server can at times be more complicated than
necessary, and for that reason, the MySQL Utilities are designed to
help out with common tasks for both beginners and experienced database
administrators.

MySQL Utilities are designed as a collection of easy to use Python
scripts that can be combined into more powerful features. The scripts
internally make use of the :ref:`mysql.utilities` module to perform
it's various tasks.  Since a library of common functions are
available, it is easy for a database administrator to create his/her
own scripts for common tasks.
