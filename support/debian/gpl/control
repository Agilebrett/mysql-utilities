Description: Collection of scripts for managing MySQL servers
 MySQL Utilities is both a set of command-line utilities as well as a 
 python library, developed for making the common tasks easy to 
 accomplish. It is a package of utilities that are used for maintenance 
 and administration of MySQL servers. These utilities encapsulate a set 
 of primitive commands, and bundles them so they can be used to perform 
 macro operations with a single command.
